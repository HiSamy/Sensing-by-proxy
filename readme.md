# Sensing by proxy: Occupancy Detection via Environmental Sensing

* **Contents:** We provide a brief description of the code and data.

* **Structure:** This archive contains a Code section to place the main functions, a Data section to store the data used in the paper.

## How to use:

* The main code for Sensing by proxy is implemented in simulateobserver.m

* To reproduce the MSE of sensing by proxy, please run sensingbyproxy_[experiment].m

* To reproduce the cross-correlation values for the measurements at different locations, please run the calc_crosscorr.m. 

* The results for the projected ventilation is obtained by running energy_simulations.m
